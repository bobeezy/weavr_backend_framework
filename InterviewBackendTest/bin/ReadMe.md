# QA Engineer test

### This is a sample project to test APIs using JUnit and RestAssured. In this project you will find the configuration required to write tests for a number of endpoints by Go Rest (https://gorest.co.in/), as well as a sample test class to start with.

##### Requirements:

- Using the already implemented create user endpoint, write a number of tests to cover the functionality of this endpoint
- Implement whatever is required to write tests for the update user endpoint

###### The information required to perform those tasks can be found here -> https://gorest.co.in/. Feel free to update the project in any way you see fit.
